# Info

- **Coding Exercise 4 (NodeJS-JWT-Authentication-Test) for ITIS 4166 (Network Based App Development)**
- **Term Class Taken: Spring 2020**
- **Please follow along with the video 07b - Authentication/Authorization.**
- **After that is done:**
     1. Create 1 more route (called settings) and protect this route with the JWT solution
     2. The final result will be:
        1. Index >> with the login (already done - not protected)
        2. Dashboard (already done - protected)
        3. Settings (needs to be done - should be protected)
        4. Add a button on the Homepage so you can access the new route "settings"
        5. Use the HTML5 API History.pushstate (Links to an external site.) to update the URL when you change the route
